        "Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models\n",
        "\n",
        "- Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemma have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP tasks. An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge, such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned with domain-specific data to perform downstream tasks (such as sentiment analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "- LLMs are extremely large in size (parameters in the order of billions). Full fine-tuning (which updates all the parameters in the model) is not required for most applications because typical fine-tuning datasets are relatively much smaller than the pre-training datasets.\n",

This dataset contains 15,000 high-quality human-generated prompt / response pairs specifically designed for fine-tuning LLMs."
